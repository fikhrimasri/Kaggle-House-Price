# Competition Description
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the<br>
basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset<br>
proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.<br>

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this<br> 
competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.<br>

# Practice Skills
Creative feature engineering<br>
